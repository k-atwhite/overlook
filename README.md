## Project Goals
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application


## Project Overview & User Stories
Overlook Hotel is a Vanilla JS application that showcases what we have learned during Module 2 of Turing's Front End program. The user can log into their account, view their past and future stays at Overlook, check to see what rooms are available for specific dates, filter by room types, and book their stay!

## How to use the app
### Server Setup
To set up the data server, run the following commands:  
`git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/overlook-api.git`  
`cd overlook-api`  
`npm install`  
`npm start`  
Then, open a new Terminal window

### App Setup
In the new Terminal window, run the following commands:  
`git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/overlook-api.git`  
`cd overlook`  
`npm install`  
`npm start`  
Open a window in your web browser of choice, and visit `localhost:8080` to view the app!

## Future Additions
There are so many ways to grow this site. Several examples could be:
1. Improved modals, such as modals for past trips, booked rooms with futher details. 

2. Images for each room - to better showcase what is available and the differences between each room.

3. Log in for a manager to be able to make administrative alterations.
